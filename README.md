# What this is
I made a simple way to set up a program that will take a full screenshot of my screen (for myself). I then added another simple "fix" - you can make an "overlay" so there is an overlay you can create for screenshots automatically.

# How to use this
- Compile Screeny
- Create a shortcut to "Screeny.exe"
- Right-click it and go to properties
- Click "Shortcut Key"
- Press the keys for the shortcut
- Click "Apply" then "ok"

You can now use "Screeny"

# Add an Overlay
To add an "overlay" is simple. Just create an "overlay.png" next to the EXE, make shortcut, etc. It will make the setup for you, it is easy and simple to understand.
